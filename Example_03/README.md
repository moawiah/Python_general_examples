## Scanning a path recursively

This is a python script to scan a path recursively and performs the following:

1- lists all the files in a directory recursively.
2- produce a csv file with the following output `<number>,<file-path>,<md5-of-the-file>`
3- use parallelized calculation using a module called multiprocessing.
